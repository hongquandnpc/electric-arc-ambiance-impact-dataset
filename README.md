# electric-arc-ambiance-impact-dataset
Comprehensive electric arc voltage-current characteristic parameters dataset under various ambient conditions. Includes fitted parameters (α, β, Rc) from static arc model for PVC and PTFE materials across pressures (1-10 bar) and electrode spacings (1-12 mm). Essential for wildfire prevention research and power system modeling.
