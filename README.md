# electric-arc-ambiance-impact-dataset

Comprehensive electric arc voltage-current characteristic parameters dataset under various ambient conditions. Includes fitted parameters (α, β, Rc) from the static arc model for PVC and PTFE materials derived from the dataset published in:
Bogarra, Santiago, et al. "A dataset of voltage and current waveforms in an electric arc under low pressure for aircraft power systems." Scientific data 11.1 (2024): 1396.

## Overview

This repository contains two CSV files obtained from the fitting process depicted in the paper describing electric-arc behavior under different ambient conditions.
